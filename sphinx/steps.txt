pip install sphinx

sphinx-quickstart -  creates the 'source' and 'build' directory along with the 'conf.py' amd 'Makefile'

build directory - contains the the html templates
source contains - conf.py, index.rst, static dir, template dir

                  In conf.py, uncomment the below lines -
                  """
                        import os
                        import sys
                        sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
                  """

                  In index.rst, add the modules word to import multiple modules -
                  """
                        .. toctree::
                           :maxdepth: 2
                           :caption: Contents:

                        * :ref:`genindex`
                        * :ref:`modindex`
                        * :ref:`search`
                  """

In Makefile, Change the below values based on your configuration -
"""
    SOURCEDIR     = source
    BUILDDIR      = build
"""

If you want to add more module, then you have to update the modules.rst and you have to create a new rst file for that
.py file for example -
new .py file => sphinx_ex2.py and the corresponding rst file inside source => sphinx_ex2.rst
And in that rst give the path as like this => sphinx_other.sphinx_ex3

Inside the the project directory(where .py files are situated) run below command -
    sphinx-apidoc -o source .

    sphinx-build source build

    run the sphinx commands form site-packages folder, ex = user/python/python37/site_packages/sphinx-quickstart
